# Celery Beat

Celery beat is a scheduler; It kicks off tasks at regular intervals, that are then executed by available worker nodes in the cluster.

Celery beat documentation can be found [here](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#:~:text=celery%20beat%20is%20a%20scheduler,entries%20in%20a%20SQL%20database.).

## Creating a Periodic Task

Celery beat periodic jobs can be configured in the Django admin panel by following the standards defined by Celery.
